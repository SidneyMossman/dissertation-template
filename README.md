# Dissertation Template
The aim of this project is to build the ultimate dissertation template that can be used as a skeleton document when writing a dissertation.

The template provides a basic structure along with notes on what should be included in each chapter and an example Table of Contents.

Although different types of dissertation or research project might have varying requirements, this general template is hopefully a starting point that can be used for many projects or easily adapted as per requirements.

The template is available to download as a Word document or view online at https://sidneymossman.github.io/dissertation-template/
