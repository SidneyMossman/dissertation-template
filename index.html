  <h1>Dissertation Template</h1>
  <h2>Section 1: Dissertation template structure</h2>
  <p>Most dissertations follow a similar template structure in terms of their chapter/section format and are designed to present your work in a clear and logical manner.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>The abstract provides a summary of the issues that have been researched and an overview of its findings. Generally, it is expected to be within the region of 250-300 words, which means it is important to keep it brief and to the point. Due to its content, the abstract should be the last part of the dissertation that you right.</p>
  
  <h3>Table of contents</h3>
  <h3>List of figures</h3>
  <h3>List of tables</h3>
  <p>The three above sections are self-explanatory. However, one of the mistakes often made is a failure to update these details once the dissertation has been completed. If you have access to Microsoft Word or another similar software programme, it is recommended that you use the automatic table of contents and list options, which in the Microsoft 365 version of Word are found in the Table of Contents group and Captions group on the References ribbon within the document. Note that “Insert Table of Figures” in the Captions group is also used to insert a list of tables. The advantage of this approach is that, providing you have accurately applied the style format throughout the dissertation, the lists can be automatically updated, rather than having to spend time trying to do it manually.</p>
